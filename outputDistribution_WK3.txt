These are three managed variables by grouping. The original variables (Age, S4AQ6A, S4AQ7) are numbers, and 
the new variable grouped them into clusers. For example, Age is grouped into young, middle, and old, which stands 
for different age groups. 

The frequency of each group is represented by 'Perc' below. Take the AgeGroup as an example, it indicates the frequency 
of how often the age falls into different groups. 

The NA data stands for missing entries. For the cases, like AgeGroup, there is no missing entries because each individual
has an age that falls into the 3 age groups. For other cases, like S4AQ7_GRP, there are significant amount of missing data.
These missing data is caused by answers like 'unknown', or the situation does not apply. For particular this case, 
S4AQ7_GRP stands for the age that the individual starts looking for help for depression, however, not everybody has 
problem of depression, and thus this variable does not apply for those who had no depression issues. 
In this case, it shows up as an NA value.
